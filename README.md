This is a simple Flask web application that uses the pretrained MobileNetV2 model to classify whether an uploaded image contains a cat. The model is loaded with ImageNet weights and performs inference on user-uploaded images via a web interface.

## Features

- Uses TensorFlow Keras MobileNetV2 pretrained on ImageNet
- Detects if an image contains a cat based on classification labels
- Returns the top prediction label and confidence score
- REST API endpoint /predict to upload images and get predictions
- Web page at / to upload images and view results:

## Tools/Languages:
 - Python & HTML
 - Python libraries: Flask, PIL, io, Numpy
 - Tensor Keras Preprocessing for converting images into arrays/vectors which the model can process
   
## Installation

1. Clone the repository(use these commands in cmd, power shell etc):
 ```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
```bash
  python -m venv venv
  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Run the Flask app:
```bash
   python app.py
```
3. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:5000/
4. Upload an image to check if it contains a cat. The result will show if a cat was detected, the predicted label, and confidence.
